First of all I want to say we serve a BIG God. October 24th, 2019 around 2:30pm I was hit by a car on my way home after doing a few things at church. I don’t remember most of what happened and I’m thankful for that. When I was able to process what was going on I knew instantly I had a broken arm. The pain was so intense I almost passed out. It didn’t take long for EMTs, Fire Dept., and police to arrive and get me to the ER. When I got there Dr. Holt and the nursing staff did their usual routine checks and did an x-ray of my arm. They told me I was going to need surgery but would have to wait until Tuesday before Dr. Weiss could do whatever needed to be done. The weekend was a little rough but I knew God was already doing some serious work. Tuesday morning came and myself as well as one of our church leaders (Barry Clegg) went to GSH to get me ready for surgery. We waited for what seemed like forever to see Dr. Weiss. She was still planning to do surgery at the time but decided to do a few more x-rays before taking me back. After looking at the x-rays she saw that the bone had already lined back up where it was supposed to be. She said at this point surgery would not really be beneficial unless I started hurting really bad. Aside from some discomfort and struggling with getting to sleep I feel pretty good. I still have a long way to go but I’m so thankful to everyone that has been praying for me, the EMTs at Knox County EMS, Vincennes fire Dept, Vincennes Police Dept., and the man from Best One tire who helped get me out of the street, but most importantly I want to thank God. I would like to end this by saying I’ve been praying for the woman that hit me and have decided when I find out how to reach her I want to offer her forgiveness and invite her to Thursday Church. Several people have said I should be ticked off and dislike her but that wouldn’t do her or me any good. Not one person on Earth deserves grace but God offers it anyway, so how could I go through the rest of my life and not show His grace by not offering forgiveness to someone for their mistakes? Forgiveness is something I have always struggled with but God has been working on this the last couple of months and my heart is changed because of this accident. If God can do this for me he can do it for you as well. He can take the biggest mess and turn it into an even bigger message.
